    Q: Can I merge lambda0 and anti-lambda0?
       I know I need to see lambda0_b and anti-lambda0_b. But if I merge
       lambda0 and anti-lambda0, I have no ways to identify them.

    refresh the code on git-hub: There is a BPHMassSymSelect.h added
    BPHMassesSymSelect.h is used in BPHKx0ToKPiBuilder.cc
    Needed to modify BPHLambdaxToKPBuilder.cc && BPHLambda0ToPPiBuilder.cc
